        "A couple of things I noticed just right off the bat is the camera angle and head spacing between the guest and the hosts are just way off.",

        "Lighting overall feels harsh. Subject is very well-lit and the background is also well-lit, there should be some contrast so it doesn't feel equally well-lit."
